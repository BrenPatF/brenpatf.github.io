In my last Oracle User Group presentation, [Database API Viewed As A Mathematical Function: Insights into Testing](https://www.slideshare.net/brendanfurey7/database-api-viewed-as-a-mathematical-function-insights-into-testing), I discussed how the concept of the pure function can be extremely useful in the context of automated testing of database APIs.

In this article I show how the concept can also be useful in testing, and writing, SQL queries regardless of whether or not automated testing is in use. The idea is that queries often contain complex logic involving CASE, Nvl and other logical constructs, as well as retrieval of database data. If we could somehow separate out the pure logical part from the impure database accesses, we may be able to do more effective testing, since pure functions are inherently easier to test than impure ones. We will show this by means of a simple example against the Oracle HR demo schema.

Suppose we want to calculate an employee bonus using the following logic:

- Use a 10% multiplier applied to one of two salaries...
- ...for department managers, use the departmental average salary; for others, use their own salary
- For employees who have been previously employed, i.e. who have a job history record, add a further 10%
- For employees whose job is 'IT\_PROG', add a (well deserved ðŸ™‚) further 50%

Here is a query to calculate this:

```sql
WITH depsals AS (
  SELECT dep.department_id, dep.manager_id, Avg(emp.salary) avgsal
    FROM departments dep
    JOIN employees emp ON emp.department_id = dep.department_id
    GROUP BY Dep.department_id, dep.manager_id
)
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.salary, dsl.avgsal,
       Round(Nvl(dsl.avgsal, emp.salary) * 0.1 *
       Nvl2(jhs.employee_id, 1.1, 1) *
       CASE job.job_id WHEN 'IT_PROG' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END) bonus
  FROM employees emp
  JOIN jobs job
    ON emp.job_id = job.job_id
  LEFT JOIN depsals dsl
    ON dsl.manager_id = emp.employee_id
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT employee_id FROM job_history GROUP BY employee_id) jhs
    ON jhs.employee_id = emp.employee_id
 ORDER BY 1
```

We see the bonus calculation in the select list with fields embedded from tables and a subquery. Setting up test data in multiple tables, and filtering out database noise can be a difficult task, so it would be nice if we could bypass that to test the calculation logic independently. If we are on version 12.1 or higher we can facilitate this by making the calculation into a WITH function, like this:

```sql
WITH FUNCTION calc_bonus(p_jhs_emp_id NUMBER, p_job_id VARCHAR2, p_salary NUMBER, p_avgsal NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
  RETURN Round(0.1 *
    Nvl(p_avgsal, p_salary) * 
    CASE WHEN p_jhs_emp_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 1.1 END *
    CASE p_job_id WHEN 'IT_PROG' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END);
END;
depsals AS (
  SELECT dep.department_id, dep.manager_id, Avg(emp.salary) avgsal
    FROM departments dep
    JOIN employees emp ON emp.department_id = dep.department_id
    GROUP BY Dep.department_id, dep.manager_id
)
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.salary, dsl.avgsal,
       calc_bonus(jhs.employee_id, job.job_id, emp.salary, dsl.avgsal) bonus
  FROM employees emp
  JOIN jobs job
    ON emp.job_id = job.job_id
  LEFT JOIN depsals dsl
    ON dsl.manager_id = emp.employee_id
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT employee_id FROM job_history GROUP BY employee_id) jhs
    ON jhs.employee_id = emp.employee_id
 ORDER BY 1
```

Now the declared function, which is 'pure', separates out the calculation logic from the impure parts of the query that reference database fields. We can now test this function by replacing the rest of the query with a test data generator designed to cover all scenarios.

In the presentation referenced above I discussed how to assess test coverage properly, in terms of behavioural, or scenario, coverage, rather than the popular but spurious 'code coverage' metrics. I explained the value of thinking in terms of domain and subdomain partitioning to maximise true test coverage. If the subdomains are orthogonal (or independent) we can test behaviour across their partitions in parallel. What about the current case? We can see that we have three subdomains, each having two partitions, and in fact they are interdependent (because they multiply together an error in one factor could neutralise an error in another): that means we need 2x2x2 = 8 test records. There is no need to vary the base salary, so we will use a bind variable:

```sql
VAR SALARY NUMBER
EXEC :SALARY := 20000
```

The query with test data generator is then:

```sql
WITH FUNCTION calc_bonus(p_jhs_emp_id NUMBER, p_job_id VARCHAR2, p_salary NUMBER, p_avgsal NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
BEGIN
  RETURN Round(0.1 *
    Nvl(p_avgsal, p_salary) * 
    CASE WHEN p_jhs_emp_id IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 1.1 END *
    CASE p_job_id WHEN 'IT_PROG' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END);
END;
test_data AS (
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL

  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, 10000 avgsal FROM DUAL
)
SELECT dat.jhs_emp_id, dat.job_id,  dat.avgsal,
       calc_bonus(dat.jhs_emp_id, dat.job_id, :SALARY, dat.avgsal) bonus
  FROM test_data dat
 ORDER BY 1, 2, 3
```

Test results:

```
JHS_EMP_ID JOB_ID      AVGSAL      BONUS
---------- ------- ---------- ----------
         1 IT_PROG      10000       1650
         1 IT_PROG                  3300
         1 OTHER        10000       1100
         1 OTHER                    2200
           IT_PROG      10000       1500

           OTHER                    2000
```

The results can be checked manually, and there is probably little value in automating this beyond scripting.

Ok, but what if we are on a database version prior to 12.1, or for some reason we don't want to use a WITH function? In that case, we can do something similar, but not quite as cleanly because we will need to modify the code under test slightly, to reference the test data subquery:

```sql
WITH test_data AS (
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, NULL  avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, 10000 avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'OTHER'   job_id, 10000 avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT NULL jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, 10000 avgsal FROM DUAL UNION ALL
  SELECT 1    jhs_emp_id, 'IT_PROG' job_id, 10000 avgsal FROM DUAL
)
SELECT dat.jhs_emp_id, dat.job_id,  dat.avgsal,
       Round(Nvl(dat.avgsal, :SALARY) * 0.1 *
       Nvl2(dat.jhs_emp_id, 1.1, 1) *
       CASE dat.job_id WHEN 'IT_PROG' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END) bonus
  FROM test_data dat
 ORDER BY 1, 2, 3
```

## Conclusion

We have shown how extracting pure functionality from a query can help in making testing more rigorous and modular.

We have also shown how the WITH function feature, new in v12.1, can be used to extract pure functions from the main SQL and so enhance modularity and testability. This is a usage for the feature that is not commonly noted, the advantage usually cited being replacement of database functions to avoid context switches.
