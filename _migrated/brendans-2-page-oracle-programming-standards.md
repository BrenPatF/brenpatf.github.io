I recently had some discussions on PL/SQL coding standards centred around some documents Iâ€™d come across on the internet, as well as some internal company standards documents.

Here are a couple of extensive company standards documents that have been made public:
- [PL/SQL & SQL Coding Guidelines (Insum)](https://insum-labs.github.io/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/v1.1/Insum-PLSQL-and-SQL-Coding-Guidelines.pdf)
- [PL/SQL & SQL Coding Guidelines (Trivadis)](https://trivadis.github.io/plsql-and-sql-coding-guidelines/v4.4/)

And this is another interesting document, by William Robertson, which emphasizes common sense in application of standards:
- [Naming and Coding Standards for SQL and PL/SQL](http://williamrobertson.net/documents/plsqlcodingstandards.html)

These are all valuable documents, but it was thought that many developers would not read and remain familiar with long documents of this kind, and a 2-page summary standards might be useful. Here is my attempt, as a Word document on Scribd:
