<h2>Walking to Work, 19 July 2012</h2>

I like to walk to work when I can and I don't mind going a fair distance as it's a good way to maintain a base fitness. I also find it a good time to think about technical stuff away from the computer. This <em>odyssey</em> represents my journey to IFSC via Phoenix Park and the Quays, from Auburn Avenue roundabout, for a three month period mid-2012. It's about 9km distance, and I took the photos at 5 minute intervals. I got the bus back.
